About This Project:
CA_TWO project of PROGRAMMING FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
I develop a flask website "RMA Tracking System" for a customer to request technical support in case the device purchased malfunctions and for the technical staff to keep a record of the faulty devices. It uses Flask at the backend Javascript at the front end and MariaDB for storing data.
